## Getting Started

0. Before everything, you should have Docker and Docker Compose in your computer (Docker desktop includes both).

1. Clone this repo and cd into your directory.
    
    git clone git@github.com:fintual-oss/paraffin.git && cd paraffin

2. In another terminal window, build and run your app with Compose.

    `$ docker compose up --build`

3. You need to create the database. In another terminal, run:

    `$ docker compose run web rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`

4. Finally, enter http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to see the application running.
